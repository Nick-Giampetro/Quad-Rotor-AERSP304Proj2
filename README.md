AERSP 304 Project 2

Project by Nicholas Giampetro, Craig Stenstrom, Payton Glynn

Originally completed for AERSP 304 on 4/4/2023, this repository serves to archive this project for myself and my colleagues who worked on it.

MATLAB program that utilizes ODE45 to numerically analyzes the dynamics of a small quad-rotor drone as well as simulate an autopilot to control the quad-rotor based on a consant reference signal.
